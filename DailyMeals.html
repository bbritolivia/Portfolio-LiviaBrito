            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>
              To design a responsive web app for recipes that meets the needs of its users and solves the problems they are facing with existing recipe apps.
            </p>
            <h3>Role:</h3>
            <p>
              My role in this project was to develop the whole UX phase (competitive analysis, user research, create user personas, user flows and wireframing) and also, the UI phase (create moodboard, style guide, preference testing, breakpoints, responsive grid and final screens).
            </p>
            <h3>Duration of The Project:</h3>
            <p>
              It took me 3 months to complete the whole project. From the beginning of the research phase until the mockups and final designs.
            </p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
Everyday people ask themselves the same question: “what am I going to eat today?”. This can be
exhausting and sometimes, it is better just to eat the same thing again or order the food rather than make
“hard” decisions daily.
            </p>
            <p>
Daily Meals help users to organize themselves to eat less processed food and yet, be able to cook faster
and smarter. An app where the user will have personalized daily recommendations of what to cook, with
clear information on how many dishes they will use, the preparation time and the difficulty level of each
recipe.

        <h3>Competitive analysis:</h3>
          <p>
            In order to Identify underserved opportunities in the market and what can be improved, a competitive analysis was performed based on these areas: Competitor Overview, Marketing Profile, SWOT Analysis and UX Analysis.

        <h3>User Research:</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most important processes in this project was the application of user-centred design. From the beginning of the development and during all of it. Therefore, a User Research was conducted to be sure on what potential users think and which are their main pain points.

        <div>
        <h3>User Personas:</h3>
          <p>
            In order to maintain user-centred design processes, it was important to create user personas. They helped me alongside the whole project to keep myself oriented to design something that makes sense for real users and will actually help them in their needs.

        <h3>User Flows & Rapid Prototyping:</h3>
          <p>
            User flows and Rapid Prototyping were also indispensable in this project. Both acted as a first phase for visualizing every step needed to accomplish the main tasks in the app.

        <div>
        <h3>Moodboard:</h3>
          <p>
            Building a moodboard was another very important tool to guide the entire process of visual development of the app and keep its appearance consistent.
          </p>

        <div>
        <h3>Style Guide:</h3>
          <p>
            Using the moodboard as a basis, building a style guide was also essential to maintain a consistent layout. In this part, with more specific elements such as paragraph styles, buttons and icons. I used the tool Frontify to help me in this step.

        <h3>Preference Testing:</h3>
          <p>
            In order to maintain a user-centric design, a test session was again conducted with real people. This time, with UsabilityHub, I ran a preference test between two main screen options.

        <h3>Breakpoints & Responsive Grid:</h3>
          <p>
            Since this project aimed to be a responsive web app, it was necessary to build a fluid grid to follow the different breakpoints of the screens.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          This project gave me a lot of maturity during its development. Since I had the opportunity to experiment and understand every step of the process, I realized that things can take too much time to be completed. Which can seem obvious but for me, it wasn't. I learned to be more organized with deadlines, learned to listen more to people (my users - main characters of this project) and finally, that developing a project with a whole team, must be amazing!
